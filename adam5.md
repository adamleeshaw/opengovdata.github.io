After looking at this week's readings, I was trying to group data types in my mind according to how much responsibility I think the government should have to ensure the openness, integrity and permanence of government data. For purposes of this discussion, I see three overarching categories: 1) legal information and materials; 2) public data, especally that relating to government services; and 3) private data. All three are important in different ways, of course, but the fiirst two of these categories come with a higher burden for government in terms of integrity and permanence. Private data, on the other hand, comes with different obligations, namely the protection from unintentional or wrongful disclosure. 

Regarding legal information and materials, we've already talked a lot this semester about public access to something as simple as codified statutes. For most people, I think that's what comes to mind when they think of "the law," but the UELMA and Hollee Schwartz Temple's article in the ABA Journal both get at the bigger picture. Because most people probably aren't thinking about administrative decisions, treatises, or even agency regulations that impact businesses and citizens alike, those types of legal materials are at higher risk of getting absorbed into and eroded by the blob of information that is the Internet. Especially in a system so reliant on the principle of stare decisis, the inability of the public to obtain authentic legal materials would be a serious threat to the health of the open government and the legal system itself. 

Nithya Raman's article on the Chennai Project is a good if not mildly humorous example of what can go wrong when public data isn't made properly available - or at least how much more difficult things can be for those who rely on service such as public transportation. To most of us, the bus problem should seem fairly clear-cut. Although I guess 650 routes is a lot (Google tells me that WMATA only runs about 325 routes), there's really no reason why that kind of data can't or shouldn't be publicly available. This is exactly the kind of information that can be provided by government to enhance public services and foster innovation (or support "an environment of innovation and economic prosperity," as the Obama Administration's Big Data report puts it). Now, as far as the toilet issues goes, I don't know if I'd hold the government to the same standard. There are, after all, many publicly available toilets that the government has no reason to keep track of. Nevertheless, it's the kind of information that should be made available if the government has it, especially if some innovator or developer shows up willing to do the work of compiling the data into something more useful. 

For the last category, private data, Froomkin puts it better than I can: "There is no logical reason why various types of unplanned data releases should trigger duties and sanctions when performed by private entities, but trigger no legal 
consequences when performed by governments." Although I don't see private data in the same light as public data and legal materials, the government nevertheless should be responsible for maintaining data integrity at least to some extent where it undertakes to collect that data, especially be compulsion. I agree with the late Chief Justice Rehnquist's view that the government should be liable if it crosses some point where it displaces private parties with respect to maintaining and controlling private data.
