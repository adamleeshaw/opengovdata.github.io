## Sunlight as Disinfectant

As a graduate of Brandeis University, I have heard the phrase “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants” often enough over the years.  The Sunlight Foundation has adopted the famous motto to shed light on the activities of Congress; others in the journalism profession adopt the phrase in pursuit of a free and open press; and still others in the noble profession of regulatory oversight adopt the saying to support their enforcement activities.  And indeed, the history of our country has validated the basic concept of transparency as a method for holding to account those in positions of power.  Some of the best stories out of Hollywood are those where the rich and powerful abuse their power and cover up their fraudulent deeds for personal gain.  The message is that if we allow those with power to cover their tracks, they will.

And yet, at the fringes, our society constantly makes questionable choices about what ought to be made public.  We heard about RECAP and its method of opening up the courts.  Despite knowing full well that private, damning, personal data is collected in those records, RECAP’s founders have chosen to pursue sunlight in defiance of court administrators.  We see other uncomfortable choices in Tauberer’s piece, such as “Elena’s Inbox” and “Sarah’s Inbox” – projects that make the emails of public figures readily accessible to anyone.  While all these records are technically in the public domain, new technologies make searching these databases easier than ever before.  The potential chilling effect is real.  Public officials might be required to forego email, while some individuals might reconsider bringing legal action.

Was this the sunlight that Brandeis had in mind?  After all, he is the author of “[The Right to Privacy]( http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html),” the article that articulated the legal right to privacy.  And although Brandeis’ conception of privacy never would have included Internet privacy as understood today, Brandeis believed strongly in a right to be let alone.

Harlan Yu explained that our answer to this problem thus far has been to operate in the realm of practical obscurity.  But new technologies are making this more difficult.  With more data going online every day, we risk reaching a point where nothing is secret and nothing is obscure.

Given these changes, I am not convinced that sunlight remains the best disinfectant.  Perhaps sunlight can do more harm than good, chill speech or democratic activities, and promote uniformity of thought.  Transparency needs to have limits, and I look forward to future readings and discussions that address this point.  I was concerned that our readings have not addressed the changing form that transparency has taken and whether Brandeis’ emphasis on sunlight remains as viable and necessary today.

There is, of course, an alternative narrative that might yet unfold, as suggested in part by the Kenya example.  The alternative is that with so much data out there, the data returns to its original state as obscure because no person could ever access or sift through the amount of data to make sense of it.  Search engines solve this problem today, but if the Internet continues on its path of doubling every year, there may come a point where finding relevant search results is no longer easy.  I hope that we can discuss the implications of data saturation and the resulting bell curve of data utility.

## Aside:  Coding for Lawyers

I found the commentary on Federal Rule of Evidence 403 to be an interesting, and an important problem.  As Prof. Zvenyach writes, there remains the need for lawyers to exercise judgment to determine such metrics as “substantially outweighed” that coding cannot today compute.  On considering this problem, it occurred to me that computers might never have the capacity to make these types of determinations.  As an alternative, perhaps it is our legal system that should change to remove judgment calls from decisions as important as whether evidence ought to be admitted in a trial.  I wonder whether there are any feedback loops between the law and coding that might convince lawmakers of the need for changes.
